# PREP MATERIALS AND RESOURCES

We know it can be tough to ramp up on a new programming language in a short period of time. But, you can use your existing programming experience which will hopefully contain a lot of transferable knowledge that will help learning C#. Plan to complete all this prework before starting the core curriculum.

Invest as much time as you can with your hands on the keyboard coding. Here is a list of **100% FREE** resources to use and tips to prepare for your bootcamp experience, which is going to involve a lot of coding and solving problems.

## BEGIN HERE

We have designed this resource list to contain what is needed to begin learning c#.  Spend time coding and practicing the examples. Don't just watch videos and expect to absorb the material. 

Learning by doing is exactly how the experience will be in the immersive program. You'll be looking a lot of things up, rewiring your brain, and pushed all the way to the edge of your comfort zone. But, you will learn very efficiently and get some exciting wins.

## SETUP YOUR ENVIRONMENT

We suggest that you use the Community Edition of [MicroSoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). However there are a two suitable alternatives that we will support in the program: 

* GitPod - We have created a GitPod setup file in each project so you can code in an IDE using just your browser (nothing is installed locally). See [Gitpod Starter](https://github.com/SanDiegoCodeSchool/dotnet-gitpod-starter) 

* VS Code - VS Code is a much lighter weight IDE that Visual Studio and can used with our course.  Since it has no built in support for C# You may find extensions like C# for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)

Next, install .NET Core on your machine: [Download .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)


You can use this tutorial as well as confirm that it is installed by creating a small project: [.NET Core Hello World Tutorial](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro)

## WATCH AND TRY THE BASICS

* Watch Video 6 of 6: [Intro to Object Oriented Programming](https://vimeo.com/393589369/c7dbc7bb4e)

## PRACTICE

Invest some additional time practicing the basics with [Exercism's C# track](https://exercism.io/tracks/csharp). Complete at least 5-6 of the easy exercises before moving on to the core curriculum.

## TIPS

1. Code every day.
1. Don't seek to understand, seek to learn by just doing it.
1. Don't waste time searching for more video content on Youtube, Udemy, or various online courses. If you are struggling see step #1.

As long as you are getting a little bit better every day you are winning!
